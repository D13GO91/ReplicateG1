# Next.js GROQ Project

This project is a reimplementation of a Python repository into a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) application. The original repository, created by [bklieger-groq](https://github.com/bklieger-groq/g1), was written in Python, and I decided to rebuild it using Next.js.

I welcome improvements and suggestions from the community!

## Getting Started

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
2. **Install the dependencies using your preferred package manager**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install

3. **Create an `.env` file** in the root directory, and add your GROQ API key:

   ```bash
   GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key

4. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

## Modifying the Application

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will auto-update as you make changes.

## Original Project

This application is a reimagining of a clone of the new ChatGPT 01 - preview, which features a thought process for generating responses. The goal is to replicate this thought process and, using a GROQ API key, provide answers in the same manner as ChatGPT. The concept of this thought process aims to improve the quality of the responses.

The original Python repository can be found [here](https://github.com/bklieger-groq/g1). This project is a Next.js rewrite of that codebase.

## Contributions

I'm open to contributions and suggestions! Feel free to open issues or pull requests to help improve the project.
