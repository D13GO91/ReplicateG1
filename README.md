#Next.js GROQ Project#
This project is a reimplementation of a Python repository into a Next.js application. The original repository, created by bklieger-groq, was written in Python, and I decided to rebuild it using Next.js.

I welcome improvements and suggestions from the community!

Getting Started
To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copiar c贸digo
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install the dependencies using your preferred package manager:

bash
Copiar c贸digo
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
Create an .env file in the root directory, and add your GROQ API key:

bash
Copiar c贸digo
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
Run the development server:

bash
Copiar c贸digo
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result.

Modifying the Application
You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page will auto-update as you make changes.

This project uses next/font to optimize and load Geist, a new font family by Vercel.

Original Project
The original Python repository can be found here. This project is a Next.js rewrite of that codebase.

Contributions
I'm open to contributions and suggestions! Feel free to open issues or pull requests to help improve the project.
